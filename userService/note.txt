How does this behave in different contexts? (arrow vs. regular functions)

What happens if you use this inside callbacks?

How does bind, call, apply work internally?

✅ Promises & async/await

How are promises implemented internally?

How does the microtask queue work with promises?

Difference between Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.allSettled — when to use what?

How does async/await syntax sugar work under the hood?

✅ Event Loop & Concurrency

Explain the phases of the Node.js event loop.

How does Node handle timers, I/O callbacks, process.nextTick, setImmediate?

What’s the difference between microtasks and macrotasks?

What happens when you block the event loop?

✅ Prototypes & Inheritance

How does prototypal inheritance work?

What happens when you new a constructor?

Explain Object.create vs ES6 classes.

✅ Module system

Difference between ES modules and CommonJS?

How does require actually work?

Circular dependency handling.

✅ Memory leaks

Common patterns that cause leaks in JS?

How to detect and fix?

🚀 2️⃣ Node.js — Real Internals
✅ Node Architecture

Explain how Node handles I/O.

How is libuv involved?

What is the role of the thread pool?

Which tasks go to the thread pool vs. the event loop?

✅ Streams

Difference between streams and buffers?

How do you handle backpressure?

Example of a custom stream.

✅ Cluster Module & Child Processes

How does Node handle multi-core scaling?

Difference between cluster and child_process?

Use case for a worker thread.

✅ Error Handling

uncaughtException vs. unhandledRejection

How to gracefully shut down a Node server on fatal errors?

✅ Process & OS module

How do you handle signals (like SIGTERM, SIGINT)?

Explain process.env, process.nextTick.

✅ Package management

How does npm resolve dependencies?

What is a lock file for?

Difference between dependencies and devDependencies.

🚀 3️⃣ Server-Side: Production-Level Questions
✅ API Performance

How to handle high concurrency in Node?

How to use connection pooling (DB, Redis, etc.)?

How to tune the thread pool?

✅ Graceful Shutdown

What is graceful shutdown?

How do you drain connections and handle inflight requests?

✅ Scaling

Explain vertical vs. horizontal scaling for Node apps.

How do you handle sticky sessions?

Load balancer + cluster mode — how do they work together?

✅ Security

How to prevent common attacks: XSS, CSRF, SSRF in Node?

How to manage secrets?

Best practices for JWT and sessions.

✅ Logging & Monitoring

How do you implement structured logging?

What’s the difference between application logs and access logs?

Tools you’ve used for monitoring Node services.

✅ Advanced Patterns

Event-driven architecture with Node (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

API Gateway pattern — rate limiting, versioning, request tracing.

Circuit breaker pattern.

🧩 4️⃣ Practical — Be Ready to Talk About:
✅ Code Example: Write a simple HTTP server without using Express.
✅ Implement streaming large files.
✅ Gracefully handle process signals (SIGINT/SIGTERM).
✅ Debug memory leaks — using Chrome DevTools or clinic.js.
