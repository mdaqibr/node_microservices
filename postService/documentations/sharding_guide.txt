🔥 NODE.JS + POSTGRES SHARDING GUIDE
==============================

📌 1️⃣ WHAT IS SHARDING?
------------------------------
- Sharding = Horizontal scaling for a database.
- It splits a large dataset into smaller, independent parts (shards).
- Each shard = separate database or database server.
- The app decides which shard to talk to.

📌 Partitioning vs Sharding:
- Partitioning = data split within 1 database instance (transparent to app).
- Sharding = data split across many DBs, app routes traffic.

---

📌 2️⃣ WHY SHARD?
------------------------------
✅ When:
- Data size too big for single DB.
- High read/write load.
- You want to horizontally scale DB layer.

❌ Not for:
- Small apps.
- Apps with lots of cross-table JOINs.
- Badly designed sharding key.

---

📌 3️⃣ EXAMPLE NODE.JS SHARD SETUP
------------------------------
[Project Structure]
- user_service (handles signup/login)
- post_service (handles posts)
- post_service uses 2 shards:
    - Shard 1: `post_service_shard1`
    - Shard 2: `post_service_shard2`

[Sample connection code - db.js]

import pg from 'pg';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const { Pool } = pg;

export const Post1 = new Pool({
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME, // post_service_shard1
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
});

export const Post2 = new Pool({
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB2_NAME, // post_service_shard2
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
});

export const getShardPool = (userId) => {
  if (userId <= 2) {
    return Post1;
  } else {
    return Post2;
  }
};

.env:
DB_NAME=post_service_shard1
DB2_NAME=post_service_shard2

[Usage - in controller]

import { getShardPool } from '../config/db.js';

export const createPostInDb = async (req, res) => {
  const { user_id, content } = req.body;

  const pool = getShardPool(user_id);
  await pool.query(
    'INSERT INTO posts (user_id, content) VALUES ($1, $2)',
    [user_id, content]
  );

  res.send('Post created.');
};

📌 4️⃣ RULES FOR GOOD SHARDING
------------------------------
✅ Pick a good sharding key
- Unique, immutable
- Evenly distributed
- Examples: user_id, account_id

✅ Keep cross-shard operations minimal
- No cross-shard JOINs or multi-shard transactions if you can help it.

✅ Use consistent routing logic
- Centralize it.
- Don’t duplicate logic all over the code.

✅ Monitor shards individually
- Disk, queries, replication

✅ Automate backups per shard

✅ Plan for resharding (rebalancing)
- If one shard grows too large, how will you split it?

✅ Design for high availability
- If a shard fails, app should degrade gracefully.
- Add retries / circuit breakers.

---

📌 5️⃣ PRACTICAL EDGE CASES
------------------------------
🔴 HOT SPOT
- Bad sharding key → one shard overloaded, others empty.
- Example: sharding by `country` → all traffic in `US` shard.

🔴 CROSS-SHARD QUERIES
- Users need posts AND comments → but they’re on different shards → JOINs fail → performance dies.

🔴 MIGRATION
- Need to split one shard → must move millions of rows → downtime?
- Solution: double writes, phased migration.

🔴 REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
- Enforce FK constraints only inside each shard.
- Cross-shard FK not possible in Postgres → must handle in app.

🔴 TRANSACTION BOUNDARIES
- Multi-shard transactions = distributed transactions.
- Hard to maintain ACID.
- Use eventual consistency patterns if needed.

🔴 ID COLLISIONS
- Use globally unique IDs.
- Example: UUID, or use prefix + sequence.

---

📌 6️⃣ TESTING SHARDING
------------------------------
✅ Simulate multiple DBs locally.
✅ Insert test data and verify correct shard.
✅ Simulate node failure.
✅ Simulate migration.
✅ Benchmark inserts, reads per shard.

---

📌 7️⃣ BEST PRACTICES CHECKLIST
------------------------------
✅ Good sharding key
✅ Central shard map/resolver
✅ Shard-aware queries only
✅ Monitoring + backups per shard
✅ Clear resharding plan
✅ Graceful failover
✅ Consistent ID generation
✅ Load testing with realistic data

---

📌 8️⃣ USEFUL TOOLS FOR POSTGRES SHARDING
------------------------------
- Citus (Postgres extension)
- Vitess (for MySQL, some PG support)
- CockroachDB (auto-sharded)
- MongoDB (built-in sharding)
- Custom proxy layer

---

📌 9️⃣ PRACTICAL REAL-WORLD TIPS
------------------------------
✅ For 90% of cases: partitioning + read replicas is enough.
✅ Start sharding only when you need it.
✅ Keep it simple: start with manual routing, switch to advanced tools later.
✅ Document your shard logic well.
✅ Automate shard discovery for new nodes.
✅ Always have test/stage environments with same shard topology.

---

📌 10️⃣ FINAL REMINDER
------------------------------
Once you shard → you own the complexity.  
Do it carefully. Design it once. Test it twice.

🚀 Happy scaling!
