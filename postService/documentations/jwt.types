📌 🔑There are two ways to sign/verify a JWT
1️⃣ Symmetric signing — HS256
2️⃣ Asymmetric signing — RS256

✅ 1️⃣ Symmetric (HS256) — Same secret
  - You sign the JWT and verify it using the same shared secret (JWT_SECRET).
  - So both User Service & Post Service must have the exact same secret key in their .env.

✅ 2️⃣ Asymmetric (RS256) — Private/Public key pair
  - You sign the JWT using a private key.
  - You verify the JWT using a public key.


Key difference:
  - The private key stays only in User Service — nobody else should have it.
  - The public key is safe to share — other services (like Post Service) can verify the JWT’s signature but cannot sign new tokens.

✅ How to create these files - RUN these commands.
  # 1️⃣ Generate a private key (2048-bit RSA)
    openssl genrsa -out keys/private.key 2048
  
  # 2️⃣ Extract the public key from the private key
    openssl rsa -in keys/private.key -pubout -out keys/public.key
  cp keys/public.key ../postService/keys/public.key
